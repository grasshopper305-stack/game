## Quick Start

### Step 1: Set Up JSONBin (2 minutes)
**For a global leaderboard, follow the guide in `JSONBIN_SETUP.md`**

This is optional but recommended! Without JSONBin, the leaderboard only saves locally per browser.

JSONBin is even easier than Firebase - just one API key!

### Step 2: Deploy Your Game

1. Install Vercel CLI:
```bash
npm install -g vercel

### Option 3: Deploy via GitHub

1. Create a new GitHub repository
2. Upload all these files to the repo
3. Go to https://vercel.com
